# Fake News Detector using Python and Machine Learning

This project implements a Fake News Detector using Python and various machine learning algorithms. It analyzes textual data to classify news articles as either fake or not fake (i.e., real).

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to build a classifier that can distinguish between fake and genuine news articles. It uses the following machine learning algorithms for classification:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest

The dataset consists of two main components: "Fake.csv" containing fake news articles and "True.csv" containing genuine news articles. The project preprocesses the textual data, vectorizes it using TF-IDF, and then trains various machine learning models.

## Dependencies

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- re
- string

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Nahsc0/FakeNews_Detector_Python_ML.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd FakeNews_Detector_Python_ML
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python fake_news_detector.py
```

4. Input news text when prompted for manual testing.
